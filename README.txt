A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/giana/pen/yYzrLb.

 Practicing full-page coding with a <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">FreeCodeCamp </a> redesign.

Should be mobile-friendly, cross-browser compatible. Tested on IE 11, 10, cried on 9, gave up on 8. (IE-only stylesheet not included).

Pointless hover effects on everything (hover over that logo). 

Resources and content by the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp">FreeCodeCamp</a>    
Icons used: <a href="http://ionicons.com/">Ionicons</a>  
Designed in Photoshop, because I'm heretical and old-fashioned.
